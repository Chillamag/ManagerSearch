This is a mobile android app written in Kotlin.

## Run the app using Android Studio

First of all, you will need to have Android Studio installed on your computer. 
If you don't, you can download it [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)

When you have Android Studio installed, go ahead and open it.

When Android Studio is open, click on `open`, and locate this directory. 

When the project is opened, you can click on the green `Play` button to run the app. 
You can either run the app on the computer via an emulator, or plug in your Android phone
and run it directly on your phone. Remember to enable Developer Options 
and turn on the USB Debugging to make your phone appear. 

## Run the app using your Android smartphone

If you only want to run the app on your Android smartphone, you can do that
without downloading Android Studio. 

First of all, you should plug in your device to your computer. 

Then you should locate the .apk file. 
The file is located at `\app\build\outputs\apk\debug`.

Then you can transfer the `app-debug` to your phone, locate it and install it.
